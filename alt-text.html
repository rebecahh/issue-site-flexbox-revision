      <h2>Alt Text</h2>
      <p>
        Alt text is important for people who cannot view images that  are needed
        for proper context. It describes an image and is useful in the case that
        an image does not load or cannot be viewed for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's read by screen readers in place of images, allowing your image
        content to be accessed by people who are blind or have visual impairment.
        It can be useful to people with certain sensory processing and/or
        learning disabilities. It's displayed in place of the image in browsers
        if the image file hasn't loaded, or when the user has chosen not to view
        images. (supercooldesign.co.uk "How To Write Good Alt Text")

      <h3>Tips for Writing Alt Text</h3>
      <p>
        1. Be specific, and succinct - "think how you'd briefly describe the
        image over the phone"
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Never start with “Image of …” or “Picture of …” - it is probably
        obvious to the person or screen reader machine reading the text
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Include text that's part of the image
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Don't add alt text to decorative images
