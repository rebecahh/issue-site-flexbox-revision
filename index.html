      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Visuals are an important part of design. However, user
        accessibility should take precedence over aesthetics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designing for accessibility means being inclusive to the needs of your
        users. Accessible graphic design helps ensure that your printed
        documents and web content are easy on the eyes and easy to navigate for
        the largest number of users possible.

      <p>
        Accessible designs are the result of following accessibility
        guidelines and standards to create designs that are usable by people
        with a variety of physical and cognitive disabilities. Accessibility
        laws and standards are updated as technology changes, and new barriers
        to use become apparent. (toptal.com)
