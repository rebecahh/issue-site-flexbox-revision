      <h2>Keyboard Utilization</h2>
      <p>
        Keyboard Utilization is part of digital accessibility that is often
        overlooked. Whether a user has limited motor mobility or if a machine
        lacking user interfacing capabilities, being able to navigate using just
        keyboard commands like tab and enter is an integral part of designing for
        accessibility. It ensures that information is available to users without
        requiring a mouse or touchpad.

        Can you easily navigate your website using only keyboard commands?
        If not, consider a redesign — visitors with fine motor disruptions won’t
        stay long if they can’t quickly access information. (Allie Decker "How
        to Make Graphic Design Accessible to Users With Disabilities")

      <h3>Key Components of Keyboard Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Keyboard Focus</b> - To ensure keyboard accessibility it is important
        that keyboard focus is present on a web page. Keyboard focus allows a
        visual indication of the user’s location on the webpage. When an item
        has keyboard focus, it can be activated or manipulated with the keyboard.
        A basic focus indicator is provided automatically by the web browser and
        is typically shown as a border. However, keyboard focus indicators vary
        and can take different forms. Although keyboard focus varies by browser,
        there are web kits that alter the CSS which will allow keyboard focus to
        be more apparent.

        <b>Tab order</b> - Tab order is important for proper navigation through
        a keyboard interface. The keyboard tab order must be coordinated with
        the structure of the webpage. The default keyboard navigation order must
        be logical and intuitive. The tab order should follow the visual flow of
        the page: left to right, top to bottom - header first, then main
        navigation, then page navigation (if present), and finally the footer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Avoiding Keyboard traps</b> - It is important that keyboard traps be
        avoided to ensure no barriers to navigation through a keyboard interface.
        A “keyboard trap” occurs when a person who uses a keyboard cannot move
        focus away from an interactive element or control using the keyboard
        alone. Keyboard traps often occur in calendar widgets or dialogue boxes.
        For example, the user expands an accordion item, but is unable to move
        to the next item using the “tab” key or unable to collapse it using the
        “esc” key.
